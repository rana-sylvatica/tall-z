files for a tall Z button for a GameCube controller

### What is it?

tall-Z is a Z-button that is tall.  This can be nice for folks that want to use a GameCube controller but have large hands

### Required parts

To make a tall-Z, you need the button, the axle, and a switch.  Use can use the switch from an OEM GCC, a tactile switch, or a mouseclick switch.

- #### Button

See the folder titled "CAD Files"

These can be 3D printed with a consumer MSLA resin printer or ordered from a printing service in either resin or nylon (SLS or MJF).  I like nylon ones personally, but preferences vary.

If ordering from a printing service, the file labeled "tall-Z_x4" has 4 tall-Z buttons connected together.  This is often cheaper per unit compared to ordering multiple individual buttons.

- #### Axle

The stainless steel axle makes the tall-Z significantly stronger than an OEM Z-button, where the pegs can occasionally snap off.

- #### Switch

I like these tactile switches, but preferences vary.
